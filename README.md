## Code practices
The following practices applied to the project improve SEO and accessibility:
- General practices
    - Use of landmark elements (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `footer`)
    - Creation of the navigation elements as list elements (`<ul><li>...</li>...</ul>`)
    - Each navigation element set as a link within its list element (`<li><a>...</a></li>`)
    - Inclusion of alternative text for all images (`<img alt="...">`)
- Menu page
    - Food dishes set as `<article>`
- Contact page
    - The restaurant's address is set within an `<address>` tag
    - Actions have been added to the phone and e-mail links (`tel:`, `mailto:`)
    - Use of labels for each form control

The following practice aids UX:
- Use of the `required` and `pattern` attributes in form input controls

The following practice aids the separation of concerns principle:
